- [StoragePV.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lso/StoragePV.yaml): This YAML file defines a Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes that provides 10Mi of storage for a filesystem, with specific configuration options for storage class, capacity, volume mode, and access modes. The PV is tied to a specific node affinity, restricting it to be bound to nodes labeled with a specific role.
- [StoragePVC.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lso/StoragePVC.yaml): This YAML file defines a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes that specifies the storage requirements for a persistent volume. The PVC is defined with no initial storage allocation and relies on the user to supply additional content, such as storage size and access modes.
- [StorageSubscription.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lso/StorageSubscription.yaml): This YAML file defines a subscription for the local-storage-operator in the OpenShift environment, specifying its channel and installation requirements. The purpose of this file is to manage the subscription and deployment of the operator.

## [telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/)
- [LVMOperatorStatus.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/LVMOperatorStatus.yaml): This YAML file is used to verify the successful installation and upgrade of the Sriov Network Operator in an OpenShift Storage environment. It checks for specific statuses and conditions related to the operator's deployment, subscription, and cluster service version.
- [StorageLVMCluster.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/StorageLVMCluster.yaml): This YAML file defines a LVMCluster resource in the OpenShift Storage namespace, specifying its metadata and configuration. It provides a template for setting up an LVM cluster with default settings.
- [StorageLVMSubscription.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/StorageLVMSubscription.yaml): This YAML file defines a subscription for the lvms-operator in the OpenShift Storage namespace, specifying its installation plan and channel. The subscription ensures that the operator is installed to the latest known version from the specified source.
- [StorageLVMSubscriptionNS.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/StorageLVMSubscriptionNS.yaml): This YAML file defines a Kubernetes namespace named "openshift-storage", which can be used to organize and manage resources related to OpenShift storage. The namespace has specific labels, annotations, and metadata that configure its behavior within the cluster.
- [StorageLVMSubscriptionOperGroup.yaml](../telco-ran/configuration/source-crs/storage-lvm/StorageLVMSubscriptionOperGroup.yaml): This YAML file defines an OperatorGroup in the OpenShift Container Platform, configuring the deployment of a specific operator. It specifies the namespace and additional metadata for the operator group's deployment.
