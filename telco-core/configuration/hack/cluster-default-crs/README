# This directory contains CRs which are validated by the reference-crs-kube-compare but 
# for which there are no corresponding CRs in the reference-crs. This occurs when the 
# reference explicitly validates CRs which are either default or managed by controllers 
# and not directly configured through the reference-crs.
